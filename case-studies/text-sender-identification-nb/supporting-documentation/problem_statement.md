# Problem Statement — Text Sender Identification

Given a short SMS-style message and a coarse time bucket (morning/afternoon/evening/night),

## Supported decisions
- inbox triage / routing
- automated tagging
- assistant prioritization

## Non-goals
- authentication / identity verification
- robustness against deliberate impersonation without extra signals
