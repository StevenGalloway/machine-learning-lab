# Risk Analysis

## Main risks
- Overconfidence in a simplified model
- Missing variable bias (turnovers, pace, red-zone, opponent strength)
- Extrapolation risk

## Controls
- Keep scope as analytics/demo unless expanded and validated
- Add prediction intervals before operational use
- Expand features + validate on real historical games if moving beyond demo
