# Problem Statement — Points Prediction

## Context
Estimate expected points scored from first downs. This is useful for lightweight sports analytics and scenario analysis.

## Decision supported
- Estimate expected points given a first-down count
- Quantify marginal points per additional first down

## Non-goals
- Not a betting model
- Not a full game simulator
- Not production-ready without richer features (pace, turnovers, opponent strength, etc.)
