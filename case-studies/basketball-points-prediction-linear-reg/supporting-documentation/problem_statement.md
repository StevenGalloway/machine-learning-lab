# Problem Statement — Basketball Next-Game Points Prediction

## Context
Forecasting a player's next-game points can support coaching decisions and analytics dashboards.

## Decision supported
Given a player's prior-game box score, estimate expected points in their next game.

## Non-goals
- Not a betting model
- Not a full projection system
- Not production-ready without richer context (opponent, pace, injuries, rest, role changes)
