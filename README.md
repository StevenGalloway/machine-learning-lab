# Machine Learning Lab

This repository demonstrates practical machine learning across the full
lifecycle --- from problem framing and data design to evaluation,
deployment, monitoring, and iteration. The intent of this lab is to
serve both as a learning portfolio and a production-oriented reference
aligned with **FAANG-style expectations for Machine Learning Engineers**
(systems thinking, rigor, reproducibility, and impact).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What skills does this repository demonstrate

-   End-to-end ownership of ML systems (not just model building)
-   Strong fundamentals in math, statistics, and optimization
-   Clear thinking about data, leakage, and evaluation
-   Practical MLOps and production experience
-   Awareness of bias, fairness, and responsible AI
-   Ability to trade off performance, latency, cost, and maintainability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Focus Areas

-   Problem framing & success criteria
-   Feature engineering & data leakage prevention
-   Model selection & evaluation
-   Experiment reproducibility
-   Error analysis & iteration
-   Drift detection & retraining strategy
-   ML system design & MLOps
-   Responsible AI (bias, fairness, transparency)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
